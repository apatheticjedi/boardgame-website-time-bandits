				<p>You have been recruited by a mysterious time-travelling agency. Your mission: To travel through
					various time periods to locate and retrieve precious artifacts while manipulating events to ensure
					you can return to your present timeline safely. You won't be going it alone, though. You will be a
					part of a crack team of misfits assembled specifically for this dangerous mission. But be careful,
					because there is no honor among thieves. Each member of the team has their own secret goals that
					they must complete in order to win the game. Will you work together to obtain fortune and glory
					throughout history? Or will betrayal and danger leave you drifting through the time stream? Only the
					most skilled and cunning players will become legendary Time Bandits!</p>

				<p>The Time Bandits Board Game is a cooperative game for 3-5 players. Each player will assume one
					specific role with their own abilities and limits. Each game consists of 3 randomly chosen scenarios
					representing various time periods throughout the past, present, and future. Each scenario has a
					different layout of hex tiles representing the map of the area, different challenges and obstacles,
					different artifacts available by completing encounters, and a different set of objectives that must
					be completed before time runs out in order to advance. Item cards can be gained to help give you
					extra abilities throughout the game. Players are also dealt a random secret objective that they must
					complete before the game is over in order to return safely to the present and win the game. It's a
					grueling test of your strength and acuity. Betrayal and subterfuge will be necessary, along with a
					lot of luck, in order to survive. Good luck!</p>
